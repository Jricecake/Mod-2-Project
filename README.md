# Cool Plant Trakr

Cool Plant Trakr is an app made to track plants you have in any places in your life. One day, it will have the ability to track plant status, watering needs, temperament, and locations!

### Motivation

I wanted to create this app to be able to keep track of when I last watered my plants. While it is not a complicated system, there somehow manages to be one plant that gets neglected by accident. By building this, I was hoping to reduce plant stress due to dehydration and keep them all nice and happy!
